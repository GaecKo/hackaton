In Data Science, i have a dataset. Here is some useful informations:

- The dataset contains 12 features: gbifID, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species, stateProvince, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, eventDate. 
- It respresents data from iNaturalist, which helps to classify plants and animals with complete taxons. Here, we are interested by the Insecta class. 

Here is the context of the question and the question I need to answer:
When doing data sciences, the datasets you are using are most probably not made for your very application. Instead, they result from the collection of information throughout a certain period of time, and it is the data scientist's job to make a good use of those datasets.

For this hackathon, your goal is to **determine a new individual observation's most likely ORDER based on position and time requests as well as eventual other information**. By default, we restrict the dataset to **only contain insects** (see `fixed_taxons` variable). Therefore, you should be able to determine which features are useful for your application.

Can you already, a priori, detect that some features are useless?
if yes, list those (useless) features and explain your choice;
if not, then explain why it is better to wait.

Generally speaking, is it a good idea to remove a feature based on <i>a priori</i> knowledge, or doesn't it alter the final outcome?

In your dataset, which focuses on insects (Insecta class) from iNaturalist, your goal is to determine an insect's order based on various features. Let's analyze the usefulness of each feature for this task:

1. **gbifID**: This is likely a unique identifier for each observation. While it's crucial for data management, it doesn’t contribute to predicting the order of an insect.

2. **Kingdom, Phylum, Class**: Since your dataset is restricted to insects, these taxonomic ranks (specifically "Animalia" kingdom, "Arthropoda" phylum, and "Insecta" class) will be the same for all observations. Thus, they won’t provide discriminatory power for predicting the order.

3. **Order**: This is your target variable, the feature you want to predict.

4. **Family, Genus, Species**: These are more specific taxonomic ranks than the order. They could be useful in a detailed classification model but might not be necessary for determining the order, especially if you lack sufficient data for these finer taxonomic levels.

5. **StateProvince, DecimalLatitude, DecimalLongitude**: Geographical information is often crucial in ecological datasets. The distribution of different orders of insects can vary geographically, so these features might be very useful.

6. **EventDate**: The time of observation can also be important as insect populations and their visible orders can vary seasonally.

Regarding whether to remove features based on *a priori* knowledge:

- **Pros of Removal**: Simplifies the model, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving computational efficiency. It's especially useful when you are certain that certain features do not contribute to the target variable or when they could introduce bias.

- **Cons of Removal**: Risks losing potentially useful information. Sometimes, seemingly irrelevant features can provide indirect insights when combined with other features.

In conclusion, a cautious approach would be to start with all features except for those that are constant across all observations (like kingdom, phylum, class) or irrelevant (like gbifID). As you progress, feature importance techniques and domain knowledge can guide further feature selection. Ultimately, the decision to remove features should be informed by both domain expertise and empirical evidence from exploratory data analysis and model performance.
